# Hosting

## Overview

Hosting lets you store the files in Syncano and make them accessible via custom domains. In order to publish your website or application is you just have to create a Hosting in Syncano and upload the files there. Your domains will link to a default page explaining how to use CLI as a main tool to manage your application's backend. To set up your page you don't have to do anything more but upload an index file. Then the domain will be leading to your page.

## Default hosting

First hosting in your instance is always set as default at the beginning. It means that this hosting already has one domain named the same as your instance. For example when your instance name is 'hosting-instance' the link to your hosting is 'https//hosting-instance.syncano.site'. Of course you can change change which hosting is set to default whenever you want.
