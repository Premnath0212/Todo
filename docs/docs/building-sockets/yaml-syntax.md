# YAML Syntax

Syncano and Sockets configuration is defined through `YAML` syntax. Although JSON format is more popular, especially in the JS world, we chose to go with YAML because it's easier to read and write by humans. Indentation can be a part of the syntax so there's a lesser need for additional markup specific syntax characters.

> YAML is a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) which stands for YAML Ain't markup language.

## Syntax Basics

### Dictionary
Dictionaries are represented by a `key: value` form. Keys are separated from values by a `:  ` (colon + space character). Indentation and newlines separate the key-value pairs:

```yaml
person:
  name: John Smith
  age: 33
```

### List
List items are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a `-  ` (dash + space):

```yaml
- Casablanca
- North by Northwest
- The Man Who Wasn't There
```

### Multiline strings
Values can span multiple lines. Itâ€™s used to make what would otherwise be a very long line easier to read and edit. Spanning multiple lines using a `|` will include the newlines:

```yaml
include_newlines: |
  There once was a short man from Ealing
  Who got on a bus to Darjeeling
     It said on the door
     "Please don't spit on the floor"
  So he carefully spat on the ceiling
```

Using '>' will ignore newlines:

```yaml
ignore_newlines: >
  Line below
  Will actually be above
  and this one also won't be a new one
```

In either case, the indentation will be ignored.
