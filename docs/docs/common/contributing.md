To be able to run end-to-end tests set those environment variables:

```sh
# set test mode
export NODE_ENV="test"

# if you want to see verbose output from the tests (optional)
export SYNCANO_E2E_DEBUG

# to have separate account file for the testing purposes (recommended)
export SYNCANO_ACCOUNT_FILE=syncano-test

## Pull requests

#### Prerequisites

  * You have `node` v7.0.0+ installed and `yarn` at v0.17.10+ (as we use it for development)
  * You are familiar with `npm`/`yarn`
  * You are familiar with `git`, `github` and proper branching flow
  * You know how to set `ENV` variables on your OS
  * You know `JavaScript`

#### Before you submit a pull request

  * Fork our repository and create a branch from `devel`
  * If you have added or changed existing code, add `unit tests`!
  * If you have changed the way `CLI` works, update `README.md`
  * If you have changed/bumped package update and commit `yarn.lock`
  * Ensure that all `unit tests` passes (`yarn test`)
  * Check that your code lints (`yarn lint`/`yarn lint-tests`)
  * Check that your code passes all tests on `CI`


#### Waiting for review

Our team is keeping an eye on pull requests.
We will review your pull requests as soon as possible.
Next, we will give you feedback and either request changes, merge or close it.


## Style guide

  * Use `es6` syntax
  * Use semicolons `;`
  * 2 space indention (no tabs)
  * Prefer `'` over `"`
  * Prefer template strings
  * 120 character length limit
  * Do not use `console.log`, etc in code (expect debugging locally)
  * Always add exact versions of packages `3.2.0` instead of `^3.2.0`


## The Release Process

We are using [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for the release management. It's a tool for automatic version detection based on the commit message history. It also generates the change log and adds it to github. Current set up works as follows:
1. Beta Versions
  * Commit containing a fix/feature/breaking change is merged to devel from a feature branch
  * Tests pass on the CI tool
  * During deployment phase, `semantic-release` determines the next correct version to bump and changes it in the `package.json` file
  * Version is published to `npm` with the `canary` tag. It's available with `npm i  @syncano/cli@canary`
  * `semantic-release` generates a change log and sends it to GitHub (to be implemented: the changelog should have a `pre-release` or `draft` flag)

2. Official release
  * A pull request is merged from the devel to master branch.
  * Tests pass on the CI tool
  * During deployment phase, a `latest` tag is set on the current beta version. It's now available with `npm i @syncano/cli`

## Documentation

We are using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to work with our documentation. Docs are stored in the `docs/` folder and published to github pages. To start working on the documentation run the following command:

```js
npm run docs:watch
```

This will start docs local server. Open it under `http://localhost:3000`

> Notes:
- see the [`docsify`](https://docsify.js.org) page for details regarding the documentation  setup
- `docs/index.html` contains the configuration defined in the `window.$docsify` object
- `_sidebar.md` is for sidebar menu configuration
- `_coverpage.md` contains the docs landing page code



Once you finish making changes in the `docs/` folder, simply commit the changes. Doc gremlins will do the rest.
